A hand gesture gecognition and  sentenced speech conversion for the differently abled people

The project focuses on developing a robust and efficient system for translating hand gestures into meaningful sentences and then converting these sentences into speech. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system recognizes predefined hand gestures from live or static inputs. A real-time pipeline detects gestures with minimal latency, allowing for a seamless user experience. Recognized gestures are stacked to form coherent sentences, which are then processed into audible speech using text-to-speech synthesis.
This innovation aims to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing or speech impairments, offering a tool that facilitates interaction in both personal and professional environments. By leveraging deep learning models trained on a curated dataset, the system ensures high accuracy, scalability, and adaptability. The project also explores the integration of advanced augmentation techniques and optimized real-time processing for enhanced gesture recognition, making it a valuable contribution to assistive technologies.
